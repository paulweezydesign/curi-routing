# Modal experiment

[CodeSandbox demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pshrmn/curi/tree/master/examples/react/modal)

This is largely a clone of the React Router v3 [Pinterest example](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/v3/examples/pinterest/app.js).

A `<Display>` component is used to determine what to render. When navigation to a location that will be displayed as a modal, `navigation.previous` is used to render the background.

This isn't necessarily a perfect solution, but it works well enough as a demonstration to get the idea across.
